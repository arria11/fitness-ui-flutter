🏋️‍♀️ Fitness App UI Clone (Flutter)
This is a UI-focused practice project where I recreated the interface of an existing fitness app using Flutter. The goal was to sharpen my UI/UX implementation skills and follow Flutter development best practices.

🎯 Project Highlights
🎨 Pixel-perfect UI: Carefully matched layout, colors, typography, and spacing to mirror the original app design.

🧱 Clean widget structure: Modular codebase using reusable widgets and clear folder organization.

💡 Learning-focused: Created as a self-driven challenge to improve my Flutter UI design skills.
